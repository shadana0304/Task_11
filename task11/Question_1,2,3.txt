Task 11
Q.1 Four access modifiers

1. Public 
* It’s a global level access modifier.
* When we use public as access modifier in class , methods and data member we can access in same package as well as in different package by using object and extends.

2.Protected
* When we use protected as access modifier, we can access in same package by using object and we can access in different package by using extends.

3.Default
* It’s a package level access modifier.

4.Private
* It’s a class level access modifier. We can use it only in a class.

Q.2 Difference between Exception and error

Exception:
      •	It’s like an error. Whenever it occurs the program will terminate itself.
      •	Exception provide the opportunity to make your program run in normal flow.
      •	We can handle the exception by using try and catch.
Error:
      •	Error indicates the trouble.
      •	It’s not possible to recover from an error.
      •	In java , all the errors are unchecked.

Q.3 Difference between checked and unchecked exception
Checked Exception
      •	Checked exceptions happen at compile time.
      •	Compiler checks the checked exception.
      •	Checked exceptions can be handled at the time of compilation.
      •	These are the sub class of exception class.
      •	Here , JVM needs the exception to catch and handle.
Examples:
      File Not Found Exception
      IO  Not Found Exception
      SQL Not Found Exception
      Class Not Found Exception

Unchecked Exception
      •	Unchecked Exception happens at run time.
      •	Compiler does not check these types of exceptions.
      •	Unchecked exceptions cannot be handled at the time of compilation.
      •	These are run time exceptions and hence are not a part of the exception class
      •	Here , JVM does not require the exception to catch and handle.
Examples
    Arithmetic Exception
    Index Out of Bound Exception
    Array Index Out of Bound Exception
    String Index Out of Bound Exception
